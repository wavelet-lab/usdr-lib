      dflt: 0x0
      desc: Stores a snapshot of the CLKIN signal rising edge positions relative to a SYNC rising edge, with the snapshot starting from the LSB and ending at the MSB. Each bit represents a sample of the CLKIN signal, separated by a delay determined by the SYNC_DLY_STEP field. The first and last bits of rb_CLKPOS are always set, indicating uncertainty at the capture window boundary conditions. CLKIN rising edges are represented by every sequence of two set bits from LSB to MSB, including bits at the boundary conditions. The position of the CLKIN rising edges in the snapshot, along with the CLKIN signal period and the delay step size, can be used to compute the value of SYNC_DLY which maximizes setup and hold times for SYNC signals on the SYNC pins.

      dflt: 0x3
      desc: Sets the step size of the delay element used in the SYSNC path, both for SYNC input delay and for clock position captures. The recommended frequency range for each step size creates the maximum number of usable steps for a given CLKIN frequency. The ranges include some overlap to account for process and temperature variations. If the CLKIN frequency is covered by an overlapping span, larger delay step sizes improve the likelihood of detecting a CLKIN rising edge during a clock position capture. However, since larger values include more delay steps, larger step sizes have greater total delay variation across PVT relative to smaller step sizes.

      name: CLKPOS_CAPTURE_EN
      mode: RW
      dflt: 0x0
      desc: Enables the windowing circuit which captures the clock position in the rb_CLKPOS registers with respect to a SYNC edge. The windowing circuit must be cleared by toggling SYNC_CLR high then low before a clock position capture. The first rising edge on the SYNC pins after clearing the windowing circuit triggers the capture. The capture circuitry greatly increases supply current, and does not need to be enabled to delay the SYNC signal in SYNC mode. Once the desired value of SYNC_DLY is determined, set this bit to 0x0 to minimize current consumption. If SYNC_EN = 0, the value of this bit is ignored, and the windowing circuit is disabled.

    - bits: '6:1'
      name: SYNC_DLY
      mode: RW
      dflt: 0x0
      desc: Sets the delay line step for the external SYNC signal. Each delay line step delays the SYNC signal by an amount equal to SYNC_DLY_STEP x SYNC_DLY_STEP. In SYNC mode, the value for this field can be determined based on the rb_CLKPOS value to satisfy the internal setup and hold time of the SYNC signal with respect to the CLKIN signal. In SYSREF Repeater Mode, the value for this field can be used as a coarse global delay. Values greater than 0x3F are invalid. Since larger values include more delay steps, larger values have greater total step size variation across PVT relative to smaller values. Refer to the data sheet or the device TICS Pro profile for detailed description of the delay step computation procedure.
