The ranges include some overlap to account for process and temperature variations. If the CLKIN frequency is covered by an overlapping span, larger delay step sizes improve the likelihood of detecting a CLKIN rising edge during a clock position capture. However, since larger values include more delay steps, larger step sizes have greater total delay variation across PVT relative to smaller step sizes.

      desc: Sets the delay line step for the external SYSREFREQ signal. Each delay line step delays the SYSREFREQ signal by an amount equal to SYSREFREQ_DLY x SYSREFREQ_DLY_STEP. In SYNC mode, the value for this field can be determined based on the rb_CLKPOS value to satisfy the internal setup and hold time of the SYNC signal with respect to the CLKIN signal. In SYSREF Repeater Mode, the value for this field can be used as a coarse global delay. Values greater than 0x3F are invalid. Since larger values include more delay steps, larger values have greater total step size variation across PVT relative to smaller values. Refer to the data sheet or the device TICS Pro profile for detailed description of the delay step computation procedure.
