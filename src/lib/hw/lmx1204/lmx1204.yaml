Each bit represents a sample of the CLKIN signal, separated by a delay determined by the SYSREFREQ_DELAY_STEPSIZE field. The first and last bits of rb_CLKPOS are always set, indicating uncertainty at the capture window boundary conditions. CLKIN rising edges are represented by every sequence of two set bits from LSB to MSB, including bits at the boundary conditions. The position of the CLKIN rising edges in the snapshot, along with the CLKIN signal period and the delay step size, can be used to compute the value of SYSREFREQ_DELAY_STEP which maximizes setup and hold times for SYNC signals on the SYSREFREQ pins.

      desc: Sets the step size of the delay element used in the SYSREFREQ path, both for SYSREFREQ input delay and for clock position captures. The recommended frequency range for each step size creates the maximum number of usable steps for a given CLKIN frequency. The ranges include some overlap to account for process and temperature variations. If the CLKIN frequency is covered by an overlapping span, larger delay step sizes improve the likelihood of detecting a CLKIN rising edge during a clock position capture. However, since larger values include more delay steps, larger step sizes have greater total delay variation across PVT relative to smaller step sizes.

      desc: Enables the windowing circuit which captures the clock position in the rb_CLKPOS registers with respect to a SYSREF edge. The windowing circuit must be cleared by toggling SYSREFREQ_CLR high then low before a clock position capture. The first rising edge on the SYSREFREQ pins after clearing the windowing circuit triggers the capture. The capture circuitry greatly increases supply current, and does not need to be enabled to delay the SYSREFREQ signal in SYNC or SYSREF modes. Once the desired value of SYSREFREQ_DELAY_STEP is determined, set this bit to 0x0 to minimize current consumption. If SYNC_EN = 0x0 and SYSREF_EN = 0x0, the value of this bit is ignored, and the windowing circuit is disabled. See also R11 Register, R12 Register, R13 Register, and R15 Register.

When set, holds the internal SYSREFREQ signal low in all modes except SYSREF repeater mode, overriding the state of SYSREFREQ_SPI.

    - bits: '6:1'
      name: SYSREFREQ_DELAY_STEP
      mode: RW
      dflt: 0x0
      desc: Sets the delay line step for the external SYSREFREQ signal. Each delay line step delays the SYSREFREQ signal by an amount equal to SYSREFREQ_DELAY_STEP x SYSREFREQ_DELAY_STEPSIZE. In SYNC mode, the value for this field can be determined based on the rb_CLKPOS value to satisfy the internal setup and hold time of the SYNC signal with respect to the CLKIN signal. In SYSREF Repeater Mode, the value for this field can be used as a coarse global delay. Values greater than 0x3F are invalid. Since larger values include more delay steps, larger values have greater total step size variation across PVT relative to smaller values. Refer to the data sheet or the device TICS Pro profile for detailed description of the delay step computation procedure. See also R11 Register, R12 Register, R13 Register, and R14 Register.

      desc: 'Option to bypass delay generator retiming. Under normal circumstances (SYSREF_DELAY_BYPASS = 0) the delay generator is engaged for continuous or pulser modes (Generator Modes), and bypassed in Repeater Mode. Generally this configuration is desirable: the delay generators rely on a signal generated by the SYSREF_DELAY_DIV from the CLKIN frequency, so the Generator Mode SYSREF signal is always well-aligned to the delay generator; in repeater mode, external signal sources can typically utilize a different delay mechanism. In certain cases, bypassing the delay generator retiming in Generator Mode by setting SYSREF_DELAY_BYPASS = 0x1 can substantially reduce the device current consumption if the SYSREF delay can be compensated at the JESD receiver. In other cases, retiming the SYSREFREQ signal to the delay generators by setting SYSREF_DELAY_BYPASS = 0x2 can improve the accuracy of the SYSREF output phase with respect to the CLKIN phase, or can vary the delay of individual outputs
        independently, as long as coherent phase relationship exists between the interpolator divider phase and the SYSREFREQ phase.'
